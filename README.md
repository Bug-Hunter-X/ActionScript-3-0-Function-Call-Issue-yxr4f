This repository contains a simple ActionScript 3.0 program that demonstrates an unexpected behavior when calling a function. The function `myFunction` is defined to trace "Hello, world!" to the output panel. However, when the program is run, nothing is traced.

The `bug.as` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.as` file contains the corrected code.

This bug is likely caused by a problem with the ActionScript compiler or runtime environment. This might be due to a specific version issue.
